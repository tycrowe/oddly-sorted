# Title: Oddly Sorted

## Summary:
Oddly Sorted is a Java program that reorders a list of integers by alternating the largest and smallest elements until all elements are used. The output order is designed to create a unique "zig-zag" of values based on extreme sorting.

## Objective:
- Implement a function to return a list where elements alternate between the largest and smallest values in the input.
- The function should handle lists of varying lengths and values, including edge cases.

## Key Features:
- Accepts a list of integers, including positive, negative, and duplicate values.
- Returns a list sorted in an alternating pattern based on magnitude.
- Designed to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with identical values.
